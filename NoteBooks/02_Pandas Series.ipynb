    "## Understanding Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Series** in Pandas is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type, including integers, floats, strings, and objects.\n",
    "Each element in a Series has an associated index, making it easy to access and manipulate individual elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- Homogeneous data: All elements in a Series must be of the same type.\n",
    "- Immutable size: The size of a Series cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "- Labeled indices: Each element has a unique label, providing easy access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Series:\n",
    "- To represent a single column of data.\n",
    "- To work with labeled 1D data structures.\n",
    "- To perform operations on single-dimensional datasets."
